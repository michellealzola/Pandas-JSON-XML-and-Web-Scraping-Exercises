# 🧪 Pandas JSON, XML, and Web Scraping Exercises

This repository contains 20 hands-on exercises exploring how to load, transform, and analyze data using **pandas** with formats such as **JSON**, **XML**, and **HTML/Web Scraping**. The exercises are built on a **simulated Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM)** dataset inspired by quality control practices in manufacturing.

🔗 **[Read the accompanying blog post here](https://python.michellealzoladesign.com/mastering-json-xml-and-web-scraping-with-pandas-a-quality-control-simulation-using-cmm-data/)**  
It explains the purpose of each exercise and how these techniques apply to real-world QA/QC workflows in engineering.

## 📦 What's Inside

- `pandas_json_xml_html_web_scraping_exercises.ipynb` — The Jupyter notebook containing all 20 exercises
- `/JSON/` — JSON datasets
- `/XML/` — XML datasets
- `gd_t_table.csv` and `df_tolerance.csv` — Sample scraped tables from online standards

---

## 🏭 Dataset Overview

The simulated dataset mimics a **CMM inspection report** with tolerancing parameters like:

- Flatness
- Cylindricity
- Perpendicularity
- Position Tolerance

Each entry records machine ID, component type, shift, inspection result, and geometric tolerance measurements.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a simulated dataset and not from a real-world inspection process, but it reflects typical structures found in industrial settings.

## 🧠 Skills You'll Learn

- Reading and writing **JSON** with `pd.read_json()` and `.to_json()`
- Parsing **XML** using `ElementTree` and converting it into a DataFrame
- Extracting tables from **webpages** using `pandas.read_html()`
- Scraping **tolerancing standards** with `BeautifulSoup`
- Comparing scraped specs to CMM inspection data for spec violations
- Using **resampling**, **groupby**, and **pivot_table** for analysis
- Saving filtered or transformed results back into files
